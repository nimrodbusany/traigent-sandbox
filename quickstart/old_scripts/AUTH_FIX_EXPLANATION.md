# TraiGent API Key Authentication Fix

## Problem
The TraiGent SDK wasn't sending the `TRAIGENT_API_KEY` in the Authorization header when making requests to the backend server, causing authentication failures.

## Root Cause
The `TraiGentCloudClient` in `/Traigent/traigent/cloud/client.py` makes multiple `session.post()` calls without including authentication headers. The auth headers were only being added to specific calls, not all of them.

## Solution
We created a patch that intercepts all HTTP requests made by aiohttp's ClientSession and automatically adds the Authorization header with the TRAIGENT_API_KEY for any requests to the TraiGent backend.

## Files Created

### 1. `fix_auth_properly.py`
A diagnostic script that patches aiohttp to add Authorization headers and tests the fix.

### 2. `traigent_benchmark_cli_with_auth.py`
A wrapper around the original benchmark CLI that applies the auth fix before running.

## How It Works

The fix works by:
1. Intercepting aiohttp.ClientSession initialization
2. Wrapping the internal `_request` method
3. Checking if the request is going to the TraiGent backend
4. Adding `Authorization: Bearer {TRAIGENT_API_KEY}` header if missing

## Usage

Instead of running:
```bash
python traigent_benchmark_cli.py
```

Use the auth-fixed version:
```bash
python traigent_benchmark_cli_with_auth.py
```

## Evidence of Fix

When running the fixed version, you'll see confirmation messages:
```
âœ… Added Authorization header to POST http://localhost:5000/api/v1/sessions
   Bearer sk_n_8mXqLXt-eIpWeBpcOfoE8gfq4...
```

This confirms the API key is being sent correctly to the backend server.
